# Stats UI with React.js 

This small project was created in preparation (and as a practice) for a coding interview as an UI engineer at a games studio, held on Nov 15th.

- **Main Goal**: Implementing one component *(StatsContainer)* to represent a single UI element design and a second component *(StatsControls)* with basic controls functionality for the stats of a stylized in-game Enemy/Player status bar.
